# Active Context

## Current Task
Standardizing sales processing workflow across invoices and receipts:
- ✅ Both flows have consistent phases: company -> customer -> product -> order -> line item
- ✅ Invoice processing has company phase
- ✅ Product processing integrated in both flows
- Documentation needs updating

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Invoice Company Processing ✅
1. Add company processing to invoice flow
   - ✅ Add CompanyProcessor to ProcessInvoicesCommand
   - ✅ Convert Config to dictionary format (matching receipt flow)
   - ✅ Update logging to match receipt's phase structure
   - ✅ Test company creation/lookup

### Phase 2: Product Processing ✅
1. Review and update ProductProcessor
   - ✅ Add critical_issues/warnings validation
   - ✅ Add ErrorTracker integration
   - ✅ Add validation rules for product data
   - ✅ Test product creation/lookup

2. Integrate ProductProcessor
   - ✅ Add as Phase 3 in ProcessInvoicesCommand
   - ✅ Add as Phase 3 in ProcessReceiptsCommand (between customer and receipt)
   - ✅ Update logging in both commands
   - ✅ Test product processing works in both flows

### Phase 3: Testing & Verification ✅
1. Test Implementation ✅
   - ✅ Created test_company_processing.py for company phase
   - ✅ Created test_product_processing.py for product phase
   - ✅ Updated test_invoice_import.py with full sequence tests
   - ✅ Added error handling tests across all phases

## Future Improvements
After completing the current standardization work, several architectural improvements have been identified:

### Code Quality Improvements
1. Processor Base Class Improvements ✅:
   - ✅ Add abstract base class (ABC) to enforce implementation
   - ✅ Add type hints throughout
   - ✅ Add dataclass for stats tracking
   - ✅ Add context manager support
   - ✅ Standardize session management pattern:
     * ✅ Converted BaseProcessor to use session_manager
     * ✅ Updated CompanyProcessor to match pattern
     * ✅ Update InvoiceProcessor to match pattern
     * ✅ Update remaining processors

2. Error Handling:
   - Standardize error tracking across processors
   - Add custom exceptions for different error types
   - Move error tracking to base class

3. Validation:
   - Standardize validation across processors
   - Move common validation to base class
   - Make validate_data() abstract

4. Performance:
   - Add timing decorators in base class
   - Standardize progress reporting
   - Add consistent performance metrics

5. Configuration:
   - Move field mappings to config files
   - Add processor configuration dataclass
   - Add config validation

6. Processing Pipeline:
   - Add ProcessingPipeline class
   - Make processors composable
   - Add dependency injection
   - Add pre/post processing hooks

7. Test Coverage Improvements:
   - Run coverage analysis for all components
   - Add tests for error recovery scenarios
   - Add tests for edge cases in product mapping
   - Add tests for complex validation scenarios
   - Add tests for performance and batch processing
   - Add tests for session management patterns
   - Document test coverage metrics
   - ✅ Implemented proper test isolation:
     * Added autouse fixture for table truncation between tests
     * Ensures clean state for each test
     * Prevents test interdependencies
     * Makes test failures more deterministic
     * Follows database testing best practices

## Recent Changes
1. Major Processor Architecture Improvements:
   - ✅ Converted ProcessingStats from dataclass to dynamic dictionary-based class
   - ✅ Added support for both attribute and dictionary access to stats
   - ✅ Added automatic handling of dynamic stats

   - ✅ Standardized session management across all processors

2. Updated All Core Processors:
   - ✅ CompanyProcessor: Converted to new pattern with dynamic stats
   - ✅ InvoiceProcessor: Updated with session management and stats
   - ✅ ProductProcessor: Standardized with base class pattern
   - ✅ AddressProcessor: Updated to use config-based initialization
   - ✅ LineItemProcessor: Converted to new pattern
