# Active Context

## Current Task
Standardizing sales processing workflow across invoices and receipts:
- ✅ Both flows have consistent phases: company -> customer -> product -> order -> line item
- ✅ Invoice processing has company phase
- ✅ Product processing integrated in both flows
- Documentation needs updating

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Invoice Company Processing ✅
1. Add company processing to invoice flow
   - ✅ Add CompanyProcessor to ProcessInvoicesCommand
   - ✅ Convert Config to dictionary format (matching receipt flow)
   - ✅ Update logging to match receipt's phase structure
   - ✅ Test company creation/lookup

### Phase 2: Product Processing ✅
1. Review and update ProductProcessor
   - ✅ Add critical_issues/warnings validation
   - ✅ Add ErrorTracker integration
   - ✅ Add validation rules for product data
   - ✅ Test product creation/lookup

2. Integrate ProductProcessor
   - ✅ Add as Phase 3 in ProcessInvoicesCommand
   - ✅ Add as Phase 3 in ProcessReceiptsCommand (between customer and receipt)
   - ✅ Update logging in both commands
   - ✅ Test product processing works in both flows

### Phase 3: Documentation Updates (Current Focus)
1. Update system documentation
   - Update SALES.md with new processing sequence
   - Update STRUCTURE.md if needed
   - Review and update any other relevant docs

2. Update Memory Bank
   - Update productContext.md with current purpose/problems
   - Update systemPatterns.md with new architecture
   - Update techContext.md if needed
   - Update progress.md with completed changes

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification (Next Up)
1. Test full processing sequence
   - Verify company->customer->product->order->line item flow
   - Check logging shows clear phase progression
   - Verify error handling across all phases

2. Create test cases
   - Add tests for company processing in invoice flow
   - Add tests for product processing in both flows
   - Update existing tests to match new sequence

## Future Improvements
After completing the current standardization work, several architectural improvements have been identified:

### Code Quality Improvements
1. Processor Base Class Improvements:
   - Add abstract base class (ABC) to enforce implementation
   - Add type hints throughout
   - Add dataclass for stats tracking
   - Add context manager support
   - Standardize session management pattern:
     * Currently have 3 different patterns:
       1. BaseProcessor: Takes session in constructor
       2. CompanyProcessor: Takes config dict, manages own sessions
       3. SalesReceiptProcessor: Takes session_manager, uses context manager
     * Standardize on SalesReceiptProcessor pattern:
       - Better isolation (each processor manages sessions)
       - Better error handling/reporting
       - Context manager ensures cleanup
       - More flexible session lifecycle
     * Migration steps:
       1. Update BaseProcessor to use session_manager
       2. Update CompanyProcessor to match pattern
       3. Update InvoiceProcessor to match pattern
       4. Update remaining processors

2. Error Handling:
   - Standardize error tracking across processors
   - Add custom exceptions for different error types
   - Move error tracking to base class

3. Validation:
   - Standardize validation across processors
   - Move common validation to base class
   - Make validate_data() abstract

4. Performance:
   - Add timing decorators in base class
   - Standardize progress reporting
   - Add consistent performance metrics

5. Configuration:
   - Move field mappings to config files
   - Add processor configuration dataclass
   - Add config validation

6. Processing Pipeline:
   - Add ProcessingPipeline class
   - Make processors composable
   - Add dependency injection
   - Add pre/post processing hooks

## Recent Changes
1. Updated ProductProcessor:
   - Added ErrorTracker integration
   - Added validation rules for product data
   - Added business rule validation
   - Added batch processing with error handling
   - Added comprehensive error reporting

2. Modified ProcessInvoicesCommand:
   - Added product processing as Phase 3
   - Updated logging to match standardized format
   - Added error handling for product phase
   - Added product results to output file

3. Modified ProcessReceiptsCommand:
   - Added product processing as Phase 3
   - Standardized phase headers with invoice flow
   - Added error handling for product phase
   - Added product results to output file

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 3: Documentation Updates
   - Update SALES.md with new processing sequence
   - Update STRUCTURE.md if needed
   - Review and update any other relevant docs
2. Each doc update should be clear and accurate
3. Keep Memory Bank in sync with documentation
