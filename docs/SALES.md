# Sales Data Import Plan

[Previous content remains unchanged until Phase 2]

### Phase 2: Product Processing âœ“
**Goal**: Create and update product records
- [x] Product extraction and validation
- [x] Product record creation/updates
- [x] Product code management

**Implementation Complete**:

1. Command Structure:
   ```
   python3 -m importer.cli products process <file>
   ```

2. Field Mapping System:
   - Maps "Product/Service" to productCode
   - Maps "Product/Service Description" to description
   - Handles both Invoice and Sales Receipt formats
   - Case-sensitive field name handling

3. Product Processing Features:
   - Extracts unique products from line items
   - Standardizes product codes to uppercase
   - Uses product code as initial product name
   - Maintains creation/modification timestamps
   - Handles duplicate products across files
   - Updates descriptions for existing products

4. Special Item Handling:
   - Skips shipping-related items
   - Skips tax-related items
   - Skips discount items
   - Skips handling fee items
   - Skips empty/formatting rows

5. Database Integration:
   - Uses proper PostgreSQL schema
   - Maintains referential integrity
   - Handles case-sensitive column names
   - Proper transaction management
   - Session-based operations

6. Key Findings:
   - Product codes are consistently formatted
   - Descriptions provide valuable product details
   - Some products appear in multiple files
   - Special items need consistent filtering
   - Case sensitivity is critical for database operations

7. Testing Results:
   - Successfully processed Invoice file:
     * 11 new products created
   - Successfully processed Sales Receipt file:
     * 8 new products created
     * 7 existing products updated
   - Total unique products: 19

8. Next Phase Considerations:
   - Products now available for order line items
   - Product codes validated and standardized
   - Description updates preserved
   - Ready for order processing integration
