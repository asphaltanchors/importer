# Sales Data Import Plan

[Previous content remains unchanged until Phase 2]

### Phase 2: Product Processing ✓
**Goal**: Create and update product records
- [x] Product extraction and validation
- [x] Product record creation/updates
- [x] Product code management

**Implementation Complete**:

1. Command Structure:
   ```
   python3 -m importer.cli products process <file>
   ```

2. Field Mapping System:
   - Maps "Product/Service" to productCode
   - Maps "Product/Service Description" to description
   - Handles both Invoice and Sales Receipt formats
   - Case-sensitive field name handling

3. Product Processing Features:
   - Extracts unique products from line items
   - Standardizes product codes to uppercase
   - Uses product code as initial product name
   - Maintains creation/modification timestamps
   - Handles duplicate products across files
   - Updates descriptions for existing products

4. Special Item Handling:
   - Skips shipping-related items
   - Skips tax-related items
   - Skips discount items
   - Skips handling fee items
   - Skips empty/formatting rows

5. Database Integration:
   - Uses proper PostgreSQL schema
   - Maintains referential integrity
   - Handles case-sensitive column names
   - Proper transaction management
   - Session-based operations

6. Key Findings:
   - Product codes are consistently formatted
   - Descriptions provide valuable product details
   - Some products appear in multiple files
   - Special items need consistent filtering
   - Case sensitivity is critical for database operations

7. Testing Results:
   - Successfully processed Invoice file:
     * 11 new products created
   - Successfully processed Sales Receipt file:
     * 8 new products created
     * 7 existing products updated
   - Total unique products: 19

8. Next Phase Considerations:
   - Products now available for order line items
   - Product codes validated and standardized
   - Description updates preserved
   - Ready for order processing integration

### Phase 3: Invoice Processing
**Goal**: Process invoice data into order records

#### Phase 3.1: Invoice Validation ✓

   ```

2. Validation Features:
   - Verifies file is invoice format
   - Validates all required fields present
   - Confirms customer existence in database
   - Validates numeric fields and calculations
   - Checks payment terms format
   - Builds on existing sales validation

3. Database Integration:
   - Uses SessionManager for database access
   - Validates against Customer records
   - Proper transaction handling
   - Session-based operations

4. Testing Results:
   - Successfully validated Invoice_01_29_2025_23_06_44.csv:
     * 56 total rows processed
     * All rows passed validation
     * No warnings or errors found
     * All customers verified in database
     * All required fields present and valid

#### Phase 3.2: Invoice Processing ✓
**Goal**: Create order records from validated invoices

     * Amount calculations from line items
   - Line Item Processing ✓
     * Product linking and validation
     * Quantity and pricing handling
     * Amount calculations
     * Service date processing
     * Error handling for invalid data

2. Key Findings:
   - Order Status Values:
     * Database uses "OPEN" and "CLOSED" enum values
     * CSV "Paid" maps to CLOSED
     * CSV "Open" and "Partially Paid" map to OPEN
   - Payment Status Values:
     * Database uses "PAID" and "UNPAID" enum values
     * CSV "Paid" maps to PAID
     * CSV "Open" and "Partially Paid" map to UNPAID
   - Field Names:
     * Database uses camelCase (e.g., "paymentStatus")
     * Proper case handling is critical for enum values
   - Customer Handling:
     * Missing customers treated as errors
     * No automatic customer creation
     * Maintains data integrity

3. Testing Results:
   - Successfully processes invoice headers
   - Correctly maps status values
   - Properly calculates totals from line items
   - Handles duplicate invoices (skips with warning)
   - Reports missing customers as errors

4. Implementation Features:
   - Line Item Processing:
     * Links to existing products from Phase 2
     * Handles quantity and unit price calculations
     * Processes amounts and service dates
     * Skips non-product items (shipping, tax, etc.)
     * Updates existing line items
     * Creates new line items as needed
   - Database Integration:
     * Populates OrderItem records
     * Links to Product records
     * Transaction management with rollback
     * Session-based operations
